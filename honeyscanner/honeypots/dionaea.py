        Notes:
            I manually inspected the Dockerfile provided from T-pot
            (https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/blob/master/docker/dionaea/Dockerfile)
            and I found all the python3 dependencies, then I inspected the date of
            the last release tag 30 Nov 2020 I could manually create the
            requirements file for all the versions, it could change just the
            packages version. But as there only 3 packages I figured out that is
            probably not worth the time.
